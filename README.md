###### Work in progress gahdam




### for bismush and  amov's reference for now



#### Ive divided the module into 3 main functions: 

#### review_dataset() : converts the dataset into a 2d array and evaluates quality metrics. (there are 7 metrics, refer below)

#### fix_dataset(): takes the reviewed dataset (2d array) and applies corrections 

#### display_dashboard(): visualize data quality at metrics at any point in the fixing pipeline. Planning on using plotly widgets


### Metrics:

#### 1. Completeness Metrics (Detect Missing & Incomplete Data)

##### Measures how much data is missing or incomplete
##### Column-Wise Missing Rate (to detect problematic features)
###### Row-Wise Missing Rate(to detect unusable samples)



#### 2. Consistency Metrics (Detect Formatting & Data Type Issues): measures whether data follows expected formats & rules

##### Example: Age should be numeric, but contains "twenty-three"
##### Out-of-Bounds Values (e.g., negative ages, future dates)
##### Constraint Violations (e.g., emails without "@", invalid phone numbers)


#### 3. Duplicacy & Redundancy Metrics: Measures if the dataset contains unnecessary repeated data

##### Duplicate Record Count (if dataset should be unique)
##### Near-Duplicates using Fuzzy Matching (e.g., names slightly altered but same entity)


#### 4. Label Quality Metrics (For Supervised Datasets): Measures how well the labels are assigned
##### Train a weak classifier â†’ Check if model predictions match true labels
##### Inconsistent Labeling Rate
##### Example: "Apple" labeled as "Fruit" in 90% of rows but "Tech" in 10%


#### 5. Distribution & Outlier Metrics: Measures if the dataset follows expected statistical distributions
##### Skewness & Kurtosis (Check if distribution is normal)
##### Outlier Percentage (Z-score / IQR method)
##### Data Drift (Compare distribution of training vs. new data)


#### 6. Feature Correlation & Redundancy
###### Measures if some features are redundant or unnecessary
##### High Correlation Feature Pairs (Remove redundant columns)
##### Mutual Information Score (Detect weakly related features)


#### Dataset Integrity Score (Final Purity Metric)

##### combined score based on all metrics above (determine weights later)

##### S = w1(completeness) + w2(consistency) + w3(uniqueness) + w4(label quality) + w5(outliers)


### The above metrics are either implemented by using fixed rules or ML

#### rule based: missing values, duplicate data detection, data type consistency, outlier detection

#### ml based: class imbalance detection, label quality, feature correlation
